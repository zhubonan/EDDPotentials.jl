    `levenberg_marquardt(f, g, initial_x; <keyword arguments>`
Returns the argmin over x of `sum(f(x).^2)` using the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm, and an estimate of the Jacobian of `f` at x.
The function `f` should take an input vector of length n and return an output
vector of length m. The function `g` is the Jacobian of f, and should return an m x
n matrix. `initial_x` is an initial guess for the solution.
Implements box constraints as described in Kanzow, Yamashita, Fukushima (2004; J
Comp & Applied Math).
# Keyword arguments
* `x_tol::Real=1e-8`: search tolerance in x
* `g_tol::Real=1e-12`: search tolerance in gradient
* `p`: The power of the norm for iterative weight update
* `update_weights`: wether to update the weights in the inner iteration loops
* `maxIter::Integer=1000`: maximum number of iterations
* `min_step_quality=1e-3`: for steps below this quality, the trust region is shrinked
* `good_step_quality=0.75`: for steps above this quality, the trust region is expanded
* `lambda::Real=10`: (inverse of) initial trust region radius
* `tau=Inf`: set initial trust region radius using the heuristic : tau*maximum(jacobian(df)'*jacobian(df))
* `lambda_increase=10.0`: `lambda` is multiplied by this factor after step below min quality
* `lambda_decrease=0.1`: `lambda` is multiplied by this factor after good quality steps
* `show_trace::Bool=false`: print a status summary on each iteration if true
* `keep_best`: If true, return the best solution instead of that of the last iteration. If callback is supplied, use the best value from it.
* `lower,upper=[]`: bound solution to these limits
